## What do I need?

You **do not** need an iOS device to participate in our workshops. You **do** need a Mac.

## What will I learn?

In short, you'll learn how to make iOS apps! Each week we'll tackle a new topic by creating an app that introduces us to certain features and APIs. We tend to make adjustments each semester to accomodate what everyone is interested in learning, which makes each semester a little different. That said, you can always expect to learn the following:

* How to program in Swift
* How to create user interfaces with Interface Builder and Storyboards
* Making user interfaces flexible with Auto Layout
* Navigation between screens
* Table views
* Making network requests to an HTTP API

## Who teaches these?

All MAD workshops are taught by fellow UT students! This semester they'll be taught by:
